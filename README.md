# AngularPactExample
This is an example of a consumer driven PACT test for an Angular 2+ client based on [Pact JS repo]: https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js  
Install the following PACT dependencies:  
- npm install pact --save-dev
- npm install pact-web --save-dev
- npm install karma-pact --save-dev

The following changes were made to the karma.conf.js file:  
    module.exports = function (config) {  
      config.set({  
       basePath: '',  
    -     frameworks: ['jasmine', '@angular/cli'],  
    +     frameworks: ['jasmine', '@angular/cli', 'pact'],  
    +     pact: {cors: true},  
        plugins: [  
          require('karma-jasmine'),  
    +       require('karma-pact'),  
          require('karma-chrome-launcher'),  
          require('karma-phantomjs-launcher'),  
          require('karma-jasmine-html-reporter'),  
    ...  
    port: 9876,  
    +      proxies: {'/hello-service/api':'http://localhost:1234/hello-service/api'},  
    colors: true,  

'ng test' will run all unit tests including the pact test: hello-service.pact.spec.ts.  
The pact file will be generated in folder pacts by default (you can configure this in pact property in the karma.conf.js).  
For more info refer to [Pact JS repo]: https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
